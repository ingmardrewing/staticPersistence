The real life version is an endagered species - decimated by rats and humans. Die &quot;Freunde der Cloud&quot;, a Franfurt based club featuring cloud computing innovation and business talks about innovative tech, made the bird their mascot. And that’s how I came to create these illustrations - Mr. Zilch, the founder and manager of the club asked me to create these images, so they could be used on slides for the talks and other media used by &quot;Freunde der Cloud&quot;.</p>  <p>All rights to these images are reserved. © 2015 Ingmar Drewing</p>",
